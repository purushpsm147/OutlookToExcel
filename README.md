# OutlookToExcel
Here is my code to move the monthly timesheet emails from the outlook inbox of your system and generate a compilation excel report
Just run the script in powershell in non-admin mode. Give permission in Outlook (allow for 10 mins). And you monthly mails will be compiled and opened in Excel.

Few customized changes will have to be made here and there. I have made this script with my office mails in mind.

More work is required on the script to further customize the generated reports. Any suggestion and edits are welcomed.

I have added few other functionaities too. Now the report will be generated in word document with details of mail received date and number of hours mentioned for each task to complete. This is in addition to excel report generation
